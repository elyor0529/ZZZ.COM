First thing which is required - sign up on zzz.com.ua (if it tells you that you can't do it then probably your country is not allowed. tell me and I will fix it. While I will fix country issue you can make tasks locally and then upload to zzz)

Task 1
There is an array consisting of numbers 7, 15, 17, 21
1). Please write a simple PHP script that will show sum of all values (output should be 60).
2). Create account on zzz.com.ua, place the page with output on your site and give me a link. 
It's reasonable suggestion to make you feel familiar with our hosting panel.

Task 2
1). Please write a JS function called "makespace" that if called like this makespace('something') will make spaces between letters and print out 's o m e t h i n g' on the screen in alert box with 3 sec delay (meaning that alert box should appear on the 3rd second when you open the page). 
2). Save it on your site and give me a link.

Task 3, big one
Test task:
So let's say there are 4 products in the internet shop: apple for 0.3$, beer for 2$, water for 1$ and cheese for 3.74$, stored in Mysql DB (prices are fictional)
Create a simple interface where I can:
- add/remove products to my virtual cart in any quantities
- see my current cart status on the same screen (and it is updated when I add to it/remove something from it)
- click 'pay', which will deduct costs from my current cash (my cash is 1000$) , and will write the price and the rest received.

Please use at least a little JS/HTML/CSS in your code so it looks a little better
Also store products in mysql DB
When you're finished please put the site on zzz.com.ua and give me the link.
